# Newspaper Analytics

This repo is the resume of newspaper-analytics project in which I analyze the positivity of the news and your genre.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

- [Newspaper-Analytics: Data Mining](https://github.com/juanesc396/airflow-newspapers-mining). In which I collect data from different newspapers around the world, to later transform and save them in a database.

- [Newspaper Analytics: NLP model training](https://github.com/juanesc396/newspaper-analytics-NLP). When is saved the code that help me to create a NLP model to classify the collected data.
